This website provides information and resources on mindfulness, meditation, and references to psychological reading material. The aim is to educate and empower individuals to improve their mental health and overall well-being.

Mindfulness and meditation have been shown to affect mental health in a number of ways. Research has found that practicing mindfulness and meditation can help reduce symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression, as well as improve mood, emotional regulation, and cognitive functioning.

Short description of my background and my reasons for my approach to designing the website<br><br>
I have tested the viewport with digital tools and in real deployment on actual phones, ipads and PC.<br><br>

Among the digital tools I can mention chrome-dev tools and https://ui.dev/amiresponsive

### Validator Testing 

The CSS validator pointed out a warning but not an error:<br>

URI : TextArea<br>
150 Property -webkit-background-clip is not a known vendor extension<br>
151 The value 'text' should no longer be used<br>
164 Property -webkit-background-clip is not a known vendor extension<br>
165 The value 'text' should no longer be used<br>

I decided to keep theese, since its not an error and it is functional according to intend.<br>

The HTML validator pointed out the following error:<br>
Error: Element h1 not allowed as child of element span in this context. (Suppressing further errors from this subtree.)<br>
Error: Element container not allowed as child of element the body in this context. (Suppressing further errors from this subtree.)<br>
<br>
I decided to correct theese errors by removing h1 from span and changing container to main.<br>

### Content 

All written content has authentic basis, yet improved linguistically by open.ai
The source of audio and media is mentioned above.

### Accessibility

I have chosen a colorscheme med accesibility in mind, in regards of colorblindness
A font specifically designed for people with dyslexia
A written english in simple terms.
An lternative text to the pictures in use
A clear and easy to use menu.
This is all in order increase accessibility and by that the range of audience.

### Colorscheme

The colorscheme has a triadic approach, based on the color-range from "Heliotrope Gray" to "Purple Navy" as demonstrated below.<br>

### Future development
This design has the foundation for several possible development venues:
1. A webshop connected with the theme of the site
2. access-hub for people with special needs for networking with the topics as focus.
3. Informational site about accessibility online.
