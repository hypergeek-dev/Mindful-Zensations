# Mindful-Zensations


This website provides information and resources on mindfulness, meditation, and references to psychological reading material. The aim is to educate and empower individuals to improve their mental health and overall well-being.

Mindfulness and meditation have been shown to affect mental health in a number of ways. Research has found that practicing mindfulness and meditation can help reduce symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression, as well as improve mood, emotional regulation, and cognitive functioning.

### Content 

All written content has authentic basis, yet improved linguistically by open.ai
The source of audio and media is mentioned above.

### Accessibility

I have chosen a colorscheme med accesibility in mind, in regards of colorblindness
A font specifically designed for people with dyslexia
A written english in simple terms.
An lternative text to the pictures in use
A clear and easy to use menu.
This is all in order increase accessibility and by that the range of audience.

### Colorscheme

The colorscheme has a triadic approach, based on the color-range from "Heliotrope Gray" to "Purple Navy" as demonstrated below.
